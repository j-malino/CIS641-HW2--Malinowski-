This repository was created in 2021 as part of a homework assignment for a graduate class. This was an early exploration page that evolved into the foundation of my README.md you can find at my home profile view. 

## Hi I'm Jess

### Technical Interests

- NLP AI engines like the GPT-3 and GPT-Neo. Since my academic research started in psycholinguistics there is a natural crossover interest for me in these engines. I think that their use is still largely experimental and untapped, but with better training data they hold great promise. 
- Cognitive modeling. Naturally an area I engage in with research is a top technical interest. Right now the field of mathmatical psychology and computation neuroscience, both highly related, have been creating more accurate models for how our core cognitive processes are understood to work. In the future I see a greater intersection between these fields and more advanced machine learning/deep learning applications.  

### Other Activities 

#### When I am not in the research lab you can find me:

- Reading large textbooks on a treadmill in the Rec Center. I love being active and this is how I balance physical activity and a demanding academic life.
- Reading research. This is hardly a shock from a researcher, but I do make it a habit to find and read novel research regularly. I spend one weekend a month looking for new studies and then I read several a week for the rest of the month. Itâ€™s a hobby that I enjoy and replaces reading the news or using social media, for me.
- Programming small brain teasers, like leetcode, especially if it can be done recursively. I have a small collection of recursive programs and I like the challenge of converting a conventional algorithm to a recursive one.

#### Just for Fun
