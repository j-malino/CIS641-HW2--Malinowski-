## Hi I'm Jess

### Technical Interests

    - computational neuroscience
    - cognitive modeling
    
### Technical Background

My non-academic background consists of database management and creation, with some analytics experience mixed in. 
I have been involved in three academic research projects where I have cleaned data, created models, directed labs and produced custom software to run cognitive experiments. 
I am a self-starter and often self-taught. I look forward to sharpening my skills in this program. 
My favorite project is a simple game of war that incorporates a statistical model, so that you can know how badly you're losing after every round. 
I also enjoy recursive programming and writing software tests to prove that they work.
